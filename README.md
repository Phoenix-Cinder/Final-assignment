Wedding Invitation Planner
Brief
Couples should be able to choose between 3 possible invitation styles. Upon selecting a design, the screen should instantly update with the new look-and-feel.
Couples should be provided the appropriate input fields so that they can put in their vital data. Data, as it is entered, should appear inside the currently active look-and-feel. 
If you can think of ways to improve user experience, please do so! Our stressed couples appreciate thoughtful user experience (UX) that helps soother their addled nerves and nervous bank accounts.
The “who, when, where, and why” details should be very clear and easy to read.
Allow for inclusion of the names of the hosts, the couples names, time and date, venue name and location and reception whether at the same venue or elsewhere.
Be helpful. Guide the couples through the process. 
Narration & fields to incorporate
Welcome to our wedding invitation planner.
I hope to make this the easiest and most fun part of your wedding planning. I’ll guide you through the process, give you some styles of card and wording that you may want to use and allow you to make changes to the wording to make it yours.
Let’s get started.
Hosts
Are you hosting the wedding or have you family or friends to host the day? Usually the hosts are those who are paying for the day so that your guests will know whom to thank. Enter as many names as you like in this field. You may want to consider titles (Mr. & Mrs., Dr.,) and use first names or initials only.
If you are hosting your own wedding, leave this blank and I will word the invitation accordingly.
Freeform field here – reflects in invitation
Invitation
The wording here will depend on the style of invitation. Start with one style and this will populate the next field. You may leave as is or change it to your liking.
If the box above is empty show this wording else include the above and show this wording.
If the style of invitation is selected change the wording to this.
Your names
Wedding invitations commonly use the bride first and other names and the groom’s full name from the days when the bride took the groom’s surname. The bride was named first.
Your situation is unique to you so how would you like to have your names on the invitation is with you. The first name will be on the invitation first. Your initials will also appear on the cover of the card in this order. I’ve also allowed the option to reverse the order of your initials on the cover of the card.
The first name – reflects in invitation
The second name – reflects in invitation
Reverse initials? – the initials will be reversed from the above order & reflected in the invitation
